# AllStars
A small Java library of heuristic search algorithms.

## The list of algorithms:
1. A*.
2. BHPA - The first bidirectional version of A*; published by Ira Pohl in 1971.
3. NBA* - New Bidirectional A* by Wim Pijls and Henk Post.
4. PNBA* - Parallel New Bidirectional A* by Luis Henrique Oliveira Rios and Luiz Chaimowicz: the same algorithm as (3), but uses two threads, each running the search in its direction.
